import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides a CloudWatch Evidently Segment resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.evidently.Segment("example", {
 *     pattern: "{\"Price\":[{\"numeric\":[\">\",10,\"<=\",20]}]}",
 *     tags: {
 *         Key1: "example Segment",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### With JSON object in pattern
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.evidently.Segment("example", {
 *     pattern: `  {
 *     "Price": [
 *       {
 *         "numeric": [">",10,"<=",20]
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 *
 * `,
 *     tags: {
 *         Key1: "example Segment",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### With Description
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.evidently.Segment("example", {
 *     description: "example",
 *     pattern: "{\"Price\":[{\"numeric\":[\">\",10,\"<=\",20]}]}",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * CloudWatch Evidently Segment can be imported using the `arn`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:evidently/segment:Segment example arn:aws:evidently:us-west-2:123456789012:segment/example
 * ```
