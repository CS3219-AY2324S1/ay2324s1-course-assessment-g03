/**
 * Resource for managing an AWS VPC Lattice Service.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.vpclattice.Service("example", {
 *     authType: "AWS_IAM",
 *     customDomainName: "example.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * VPC Lattice Service can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:vpclattice/service:Service example svc-06728e2357ea55f8a
 * ```
