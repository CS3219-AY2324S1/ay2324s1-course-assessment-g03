import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Previews a CIDR from an IPAM address pool. Only works for private IPv4.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** This functionality is also encapsulated in a resource sharing the same name. The data source can be used when you need to use the cidr in a calculation of the same Root module, `count` for example. However, once a cidr range has been allocated that was previewed, the next refresh will find a **new** cidr and may force new resources downstream. Make sure to use `ignoreChanges` if this is undesirable.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const testIpamPreviewNextCidr = aws.ec2.getIpamPreviewNextCidr({
 *     ipamPoolId: aws_vpc_ipam_pool.test.id,
 *     netmaskLength: 28,
 * });
 * const testVpcIpamPoolCidrAllocation = new aws.ec2.VpcIpamPoolCidrAllocation("testVpcIpamPoolCidrAllocation", {
 *     ipamPoolId: aws_vpc_ipam_pool.test.id,
 *     cidr: testIpamPreviewNextCidr.then(testIpamPreviewNextCidr => testIpamPreviewNextCidr.cidr),
 * });
 * ```
