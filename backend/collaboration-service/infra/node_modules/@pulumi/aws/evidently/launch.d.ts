 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * CloudWatch Evidently Launch can be imported using the `name` of the launch and `name` or `arn` of the hosting CloudWatch Evidently Project separated by a `:`, e.g. with the `name` of the launch and `arn` of the project,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:evidently/launch:Launch example exampleLaunchName:arn:aws:evidently:us-east-1:123456789012:project/exampleProjectName
 * ```
 *
 *  e.g. with the `name` of the launch and `name` of the project,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:evidently/launch:Launch example exampleLaunchName:exampleProjectName
 * ```
