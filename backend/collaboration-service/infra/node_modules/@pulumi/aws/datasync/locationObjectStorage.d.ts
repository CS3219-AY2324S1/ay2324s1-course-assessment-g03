/**
 * Manages a Object Storage Location within AWS DataSync.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** The DataSync Agents must be available before creating this resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.datasync.LocationObjectStorage("example", {
 *     agentArns: [aws_datasync_agent.example.arn],
 *     serverHostname: "example",
 *     bucketName: "example",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * `aws_datasync_location_object_storage` can be imported by using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:datasync/locationObjectStorage:LocationObjectStorage example arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:123456789012:location/loc-12345678901234567
 * ```
