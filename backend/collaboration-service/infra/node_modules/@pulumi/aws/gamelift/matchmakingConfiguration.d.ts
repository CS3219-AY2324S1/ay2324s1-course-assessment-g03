 * Provides a GameLift Alias resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleGameSessionQueue = new aws.gamelift.GameSessionQueue("exampleGameSessionQueue", {
 *     destinations: [],
 *     playerLatencyPolicies: [
 *         {
 *             maximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds: 3,
 *             policyDurationSeconds: 7,
 *         },
 *         {
 *             maximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds: 10,
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     timeoutInSeconds: 25,
 * });
 * const exampleMatchmakingRuleSet = new aws.gamelift.MatchmakingRuleSet("exampleMatchmakingRuleSet", {ruleSetBody: JSON.stringify({
 *     name: "test",
 *     ruleLanguageVersion: "1.0",
 *     teams: [{
 *         name: "alpha",
 *         minPlayers: 1,
 *         maxPlayers: 5,
 *     }],
 * })});
 * const exampleMatchmakingConfiguration = new aws.gamelift.MatchmakingConfiguration("exampleMatchmakingConfiguration", {
 *     acceptanceRequired: false,
 *     customEventData: "pvp",
 *     gameSessionData: "game_session_data",
 *     backfillMode: "MANUAL",
 *     requestTimeoutSeconds: 30,
 *     ruleSetName: aws_gamelift_matchmaking_rule_set.test.name,
 *     gameSessionQueueArns: [aws_gamelift_game_session_queue.test.arn],
 *     tags: {
 *         key1: "value1",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GameLift Matchmaking Configurations can be imported using the ID, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:gamelift/matchmakingConfiguration:MatchmakingConfiguration example <matchmakingconfiguration-id>
 * ```
