import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides an EC2 instance state resource. This allows managing an instance power state.
 *
 * > **NOTE on Instance State Management:** AWS does not currently have an EC2 API operation to determine an instance has finished processing user data. As a result, this resource can interfere with user data processing. For example, this resource may stop an instance while the user data script is in mid run.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const ubuntu = aws.ec2.getAmi({
 *     mostRecent: true,
 *     filters: [
 *         {
 *             name: "name",
 *             values: ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"],
 *         },
 *         {
 *             name: "virtualization-type",
 *             values: ["hvm"],
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     owners: ["099720109477"],
 * });
 * const testInstance = new aws.ec2.Instance("testInstance", {
 *     ami: ubuntu.then(ubuntu => ubuntu.id),
 *     instanceType: "t3.micro",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "HelloWorld",
 *     },
 * });
 * const testInstanceState = new aws.ec2transitgateway.InstanceState("testInstanceState", {
 *     instanceId: testInstance.id,
 *     state: "stopped",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * `aws_ec2_instance_state` can be imported by using the `instance_id` attribute, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:ec2transitgateway/instanceState:InstanceState test i-02cae6557dfcf2f96
 * ```
