/**
 * Provides a resource for managing a replication set in AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Deleting a replication set also deletes all Incident Manager related data including response plans, incident records, contacts and escalation plans.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * Create a replication set.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const replicationSetName = new aws.ssmincidents.ReplicationSet("replicationSetName", {
 *     regions: [{
 *         name: "us-west-2",
 *     }],
 *     tags: {
 *         exampleTag: "exampleValue",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Add a Region to a replication set. (You can add only one Region at a time.)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const replicationSetName = new aws.ssmincidents.ReplicationSet("replicationSetName", {regions: [
 *     {
 *         name: "us-west-2",
 *     },
 *     {
 *         name: "ap-southeast-2",
 *     },
 * ]});
 * ```
 *
 * Delete a Region from a replication set. (You can delete only one Region at a time.)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const replicationSetName = new aws.ssmincidents.ReplicationSet("replicationSetName", {regions: [{
 *     name: "us-west-2",
 * }]});
 * ```
 * ## Basic Usage with an AWS Customer Managed Key
 *
 * Create a replication set with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer manager key:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleKey = new aws.kms.Key("exampleKey", {});
 * const replicationSetName = new aws.ssmincidents.ReplicationSet("replicationSetName", {
 *     regions: [{
 *         name: "us-west-2",
 *         kmsKeyArn: exampleKey.arn,
 *     }],
 *     tags: {
 *         exampleTag: "exampleValue",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Use the following command to import an Incident Manager replication set
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:ssmincidents/replicationSet:ReplicationSet replicationSetName import
 * ```
