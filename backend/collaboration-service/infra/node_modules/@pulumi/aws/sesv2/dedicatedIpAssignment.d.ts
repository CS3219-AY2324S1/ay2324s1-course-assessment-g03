/**
 * Resource for managing an AWS SESv2 (Simple Email V2) Dedicated IP Assignment.
 *
 * This resource is used with "Standard" dedicated IP addresses. This includes addresses [requested and relinquished manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/dedicated-ip-case.html) via an AWS support case, or [Bring Your Own IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/dedicated-ip-byo.html) addresses. Once no longer assigned, this resource returns the IP to the [`ses-default-dedicated-pool`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/managing-ip-pools.html), managed by AWS.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.sesv2.DedicatedIpAssignment("example", {
 *     destinationPoolName: "my-pool",
 *     ip: "0.0.0.0",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * SESv2 (Simple Email V2) Dedicated IP Assignment can be imported using the `id`, which is a comma-separated string made up of `ip` and `destination_pool_name`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:sesv2/dedicatedIpAssignment:DedicatedIpAssignment example "0.0.0.0,my-pool"
 * ```
