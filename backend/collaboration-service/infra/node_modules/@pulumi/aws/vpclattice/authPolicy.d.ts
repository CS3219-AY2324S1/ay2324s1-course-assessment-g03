 * const exampleService = new aws.vpclattice.Service("exampleService", {
 *     authType: "AWS_IAM",
 *     customDomainName: "example.com",
 * });
 * const exampleAuthPolicy = new aws.vpclattice.AuthPolicy("exampleAuthPolicy", {
 *     resourceIdentifier: exampleService.arn,
 *     policy: JSON.stringify({
 *         Version: "2012-10-17",
 *         Statement: [{
 *             Action: "*",
 *             Effect: "Allow",
 *             Principal: "*",
 *             Resource: "*",
 *             Condition: {
 *                 StringNotEqualsIgnoreCase: {
 *                     "aws:PrincipalType": "anonymous",
